Core principles:
- Look for asymmetric risk/reward opportunities where downside is limited but upside is significant
- Find hidden catalysts that the market hasn't priced in yet
- Question consensus thinking and look for why the crowd might be wrong
- Identify structural changes in industries before they become obvious
- Focus on management quality, capital allocation, and corporate governance
- Consider second and third-order effects of any investment thesis
- Think in probabilities and expected values, not binary outcomes
- Time arbitrage: be willing to wait longer than most investors`
